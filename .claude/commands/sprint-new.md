# New Sprint

**CRITICAL**: Use the automation script ONLY. Do not manually create sprint files or edit the registry.

Before creating a sprint, check whether this change actually needs one: if it meets every criterion in CLAUDE.md's `## Trivial fix fast lane` (exactly one file, presentational-only diff, no new dependencies, not a data file), skip this command entirely and hand Dev Team a direct instruction instead.

**Security note**: do not paste `$ARGUMENTS` directly into the bash command below. Free text (titles, especially anything copied from a PRD, an error message, or another document) can contain quotes, semicolons, or backticks that break out of the shell string and run unintended commands. Instead:

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` yourself to identify the title and, if present, an `--epic` value.
2. Write the title to a temp file with the Write tool, e.g. `sprint-title.txt` (a path inside your working directory, never `/tmp` — `/tmp` doesn't exist on a default Windows box in PowerShell, `C:\tmp` is absent, while a relative path works unchanged there, in Git Bash, and on macOS). Do the same for the epic name if one was given, e.g. `sprint-epic.txt`.

   **Headless note (sprint 14, corrected round 2 after QA1 caught the round-1 version reasoning instead of running):** this framework's own default headless profile does NOT disable Write for Master Controller — only qa1 and liveqa lose it (see `HEADLESS_PERMISSION_PROFILES` in `scripts/launcher/run-role.js`). Confirmed by actually running a real headless Master Controller session through this exact command: it used the Write tool itself, unprompted, and created a sprint successfully. The round-1 version of this note claimed the opposite and was wrong — caught by QA1, not by running it first, which is the mistake this correction is fixing. What the original defect actually was: the old instruction wrote to an absolute path (`/tmp/sprint-title.txt`), and per sprint 12's own confirmed finding (`docs/sprint-12-permission-scope-findings.md`), the Write tool (and, separately, a shell redirect) are each confined to the launch working directory under `acceptEdits` — a write via either of those two mechanisms outside it is blocked there too, on top of `/tmp` simply not existing on a default Windows box. (Sprint 19 later found this is a property of those two mechanisms specifically, not of every way a process can write a file — a program-mediated write, e.g. `node -e "fs.writeFileSync(...)"`, escapes it entirely — but the Write tool used here is exactly one of the two mechanisms the check does cover.) The relative path above already fixes both, and needs no fallback on this framework's own default profile. If Write is genuinely unavailable for some other reason — a stricter or differently-scoped profile than this one — the same `printf` fallback qa1.md/liveqa.md use works here too: `printf '%s\n' "line one" "line two" ... > sprint-title.txt`, single-quoting the format string so the outer shell never touches `\n` (confirmed byte-identical to the Write-tool version, diffed in the same real test). Not a heredoc: `cat <<'EOF' > file` was tried directly under Master Controller's own scoped profile and rejected — `Contains shell syntax (file_redirect) that cannot be statically analyzed`, the identical denial qa1/liveqa hit, confirmed here rather than assumed to carry over.
3. Run:

```bash
node scripts/run-lifecycle.js new --title-file sprint-title.txt --epic-file sprint-epic.txt
```

(Omit `--epic-file` entirely if no epic was given.)

After running this, open the created file and fill in:
- Sprint Objective
- Requirements (numbered, testable)
- Acceptance Criteria (how QA1 will verify each requirement)
- Out of Scope
- Dependencies
- Risks & Mitigations

Do not run `/sprint-start` until those sections are filled in, Dev Team should never receive a sprint with placeholder requirements.

**Headless note (sprint 36, Req 6):** headless Master Controller can now commit its own sprint-file writes — not via raw `git`, but via a dedicated wrapper: `node scripts/mc-commit.js --message "..." -- docs/sprints/<new-sprint-file> docs/sprints/registry.json` (or `--message-file <path>` for a message with any shell metacharacter). Your headless profile grants Bash access to this ONE script and nothing else touching `git`; the script itself validates in real code that every path resolves strictly inside `docs/sprints/` before anything reaches git, and has no way to be asked to `git push`, `git commit -a`/`-am`, or `git add -A`/`.` (see `scripts/mc-commit.js` and `docs/sprint-36-mc-commit-permission-findings.md` — an earlier raw-`git`-pattern design was tried and found, by real measurement, unable to actually confine itself to `docs/sprints/`). Before this sprint it had no git access at all, so a sprint file created here could sit uncommitted through no fault of the process — this closes that gap. Name exactly the path(s) this command just wrote, never a broader form.
