# LiveQA Live Test

Usage: `/sprint-liveqa <sprint-id> --deployed-commit <sha> --verdict PASS|FAIL|CONDITIONAL --notes "..."`

**Security note**: do not interpolate `$ARGUMENTS` (or any free-text notes, including exact page text or error strings you observed) directly into the bash command below. Write the notes to a temp file with the Write tool, then run:

**Headless note (sprint 12):** if the Write tool is unavailable (a headless LiveQA session under sprint 12's scoped permission profile never has it), write the notes file with `printf` via Bash instead — `printf '%s\n' "line one" "line two" ... > liveqa-notes.txt`, single-quoting the format string so the outer shell never touches `\n` — the identical protection, then pass the resulting path to `--notes-file` exactly as below. **Not a heredoc**: `cat <<'EOF' > file` was tried first and confirmed to fail under this profile with `Contains shell syntax (file_redirect) that cannot be statically analyzed`, regardless of location. **Use a path inside your working directory, never `/tmp`**: `run-role.js`'s own scoped profile blocks a write outside it — caught live on sprint 12's own round-1 test, this file's own example pointed at `/tmp` and got denied on first use.

```bash
node scripts/run-lifecycle.js liveqa <sprint-id> --deployed-commit <sha> --verdict <verdict> --notes-file liveqa-notes.txt
```

`--deployed-commit` is the commit SHA you actually tested live — not free text, just a commit hash, so it carries no injection risk the way notes do (get it from Pipeman's handoff report, or `/sprint-status <sprint-id> --verbose`). It must match the commit Pipeman's most recent `/sprint-ship` or `/sprint-reship` recorded, an exact SHA match, not a content check. If it doesn't, the command refuses and names both commits — re-test against what's actually deployed, or if the wrong thing went out, tell Pipeman a fresh ship/reship is needed.

Only valid once Pipeman has shipped. A PASS makes the sprint complete-ready — that means the code is ready, not that anyone is authorized to close it. Dev Team tells the user it's ready and waits; `/sprint-complete` refuses without the user's explicit, real-time go-ahead (`--user-said`) regardless of gate status. A FAIL or CONDITIONAL means Dev Team fixes it, QA1 audits the fix (`/sprint-qa1 <sprint-id> --verdict ... --commit <hash>`, required before the next step — `/sprint-reship` refuses without a QA1 PASS on record for the exact commit, sprint 36), and Pipeman reships (`/sprint-reship`) before you test again — `/sprint-status` will flag the sprint as not yet re-tested in the meantime.
