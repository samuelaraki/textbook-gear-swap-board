Fully Completely — sprint lifecycle enforcement script.

This is the ONLY thing that should ever create, move, or edit sprint
state. Slash commands in .claude/commands/ call this script; they do
not touch files directly. See CLAUDE.md at the project root for the
full command reference.

Phases (in order, with the loops):

  dev_build        -> Dev Team 1/2 is building
  qa1_audit        -> QA1 static audit (gate 1). FAIL/CONDITIONAL sends
                       it back to dev_build. QA1 re-reads the sprint file
                       fresh immediately before recording this verdict, so
                       a mid-build requirements amendment doesn't slip
                       through on a stale read. A PASS also records a hash
                       of the sprint file as audited; dev-done mechanically
                       refuses (no override) if the file has changed since,
                       rather than relying only on QA1 remembering to
                       re-read. See dev_agreed_done below.
  dev_agreed_done  -> Dev Team has told Master Controller the coding
                       side is done. NOT the same as sprint complete.
  shipped          -> Pipeman has pushed to remote. The same PASS that
                       records the sprint-file hash also records the
                       audited commit's tree hash (content, not the SHA,
                       so a legitimate rebase/squash/merge before push
                       doesn't trip this); ship refuses, no override, if
                       the commit it's pushing doesn't match. Ship (and
                       reship) also record the full SHA actually pushed,
                       as last_shipped_commit, an identity, not content,
                       fact for liveqa_live below to check against.
  liveqa_live      -> LiveQA is live-testing (this role was named
                       GroundTruth before this rename; the CLI subcommand
                       and this phase string both still accept the old
                       "groundtruth"/"groundtruth_live" names too, see
                       LIVEQA_PHASES and the "groundtruth" subparser alias
                       below — one transition period, so an in-flight
                       sprint elsewhere isn't stranded mid-phase). LiveQA
                       must pass --deployed-commit, the SHA it actually
                       tested; this has to match last_shipped_commit
                       exactly, no tolerance for a differing SHA the way
                       ship's content check tolerates a rebase, there's no
                       legitimate reason a live test and what was shipped
                       would differ. FAIL/CONDITIONAL means fixes + a
                       reship, then LiveQA tests again. A recorded PASS
                       here moves straight to complete_ready — there used
                       to be a QA1 "final check" gate here (gate 2), but
                       across ~13 real sprints it never once caught
                       anything gate 1 + LiveQA's live test hadn't already
                       caught, so it was removed. The one real value it
                       had — a fresh look after mid-build requirement
                       changes — is now QA1's responsibility at gate 1
                       (see above).
  complete_ready   -> Both gates (QA1 audit + LiveQA live test) have
                       passed. Waiting for /sprint-complete AND the user's
                       explicit, real-time go-ahead (--user-said) to
                       actually close the sprint.
  complete         -> Closed. Sprint file moved to 3-done/.
  aborted          -> Abandoned. Sprint file moved to 5-abandoned/.

The "no override" language above is accurate for every path an agent can
reach: no flag on dev-done or ship bypasses either hash check, and neither
is documented anywhere an agent reads. There is a separate `override`
subcommand below (cmd_override) for the human running this project, not
wired to any slash command, not mentioned in CLAUDE.md or any agent file
on purpose, see docs/HUMAN_OVERRIDE.md before using it. LiveQA's
deployed-commit check has no override at all, in cmd_override or anywhere
else: unlike the QA1-to-ship content check, there's no legitimate
transform (rebase, squash, whatever) that would make a live test and what
was actually shipped differ and still be fine, so there's nothing here to
responsibly re-stamp.

# LiveQA records a PASS — straight to complete_ready, no transition moves
# backward — so nothing downstream of that point could ever reach this
# branch without this widening. LIVEQA_PHASES itself is untouched: every
# other use of it below (cmd_status, cmd_reship, cmd_liveqa) is about a
# sprint still actively mid-live-test, a different question than "can an
# audit still be recorded here", so widening LIVEQA_PHASES directly would
# have changed answers to questions this sprint never asked.

# "complete" is deliberately NOT included here, and the boundary is

# inconvenient gate-1 verdict after the sprint is already shut. It MAY
# gain a VERIFICATION event — a record that a mechanical comparison ran
# against an artifact that still exists, with no judgement call in it.
# cmd_verify_publish (sprint 13) already does exactly this: it appends
# gitHead_check/content_check events to closed sprints (11 and 12, in its
# first real use) with no phase gate at all, because "does the registry's
# published content match what shipped" has a fixed yes/no answer forever,

# QA1 last looked. Verdicts close with the sprint; comparisons remain

def git_tree_hash_excluding(ref: str, exclude_patterns) -> Optional[str]:
    """Sprint 13, Req 1 (Finding A), corrected on QA1 round 1: resolve a
    git ref (branch, tag, commit hash, HEAD) to a content hash of
    everything EXCEPT paths matching exclude_patterns (fnmatch glob
    syntax, matched with fnmatch.fnmatch against each git-tree path) —
    used to compare what QA1 audited against what actually ships without
    the lifecycle's own bookkeeping ever being able to invalidate an
    audit it never touched.

    Round 1 passed a single "docs/sprints/" PREFIX here instead of real
    patterns, on the reasoning that ".npmignore already excludes
    docs/sprints/ from the published tarball" — QA1 demonstrated that
    claim false by publishing a real tarball and finding seven .gitkeep
    placeholders inside it (install.js's phase-folder skeleton), which
    the prefix version silently stopped guarding even though they
    genuinely ship. SHIP_HASH_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS (module level, above) now
    mirrors .npmignore's own three docs/sprints/-specific lines exactly,
    not a shorthand for the whole directory — see that constant's own
    comment for why a runtime read of .npmignore itself was considered
    and rejected as broader than Req 1 asked for.

    This is deliberately NOT `git rev-parse ref^{tree}`, which has no
    "this tree minus a subtree" mode — there's no single git primitive
    for that. Instead: `git ls-tree -r` lists every (mode, type,
    blob-sha, path) entry in the tree recursively; entries matching any
    exclude pattern are dropped, the rest sorted for determinism, and
    hashed with sha256. The result is NOT a real git object hash (nothing
    reads it as one, e.g. `git cat-file`) — it only needs to support
    equality comparison between two calls with the same exclude_patterns,
    which a stable hash over the same deterministic listing does exactly
    as reliably as a native tree hash would.

    PRESERVED PROTECTION, stated explicitly per this requirement's own
    instruction, and re-confirmed on QA1 round 1 by inspecting the diff
    directly: the sprint FILE itself stays guarded by qa1_audit_file_hash,
    a separate, unrelated gate checked by cmd_dev_done (a stale-sprint-file
    mid-build amendment is caught there, before this function is ever
    called, and cmd_dev_done is untouched by this sprint). Excluding
    exactly what .npmignore excludes from THIS content hash removes an
    overlap between two gates that were both independently guarding the
    same thing — this function's own gate (cmd_ship's tree comparison) is
    only asking "did anything that ships change since the audit," and
    these specific patterns never ship. Everything else is still hashed
    and still compared exactly as before; a source change landing between
    audit and ship is still caught, with no override, unchanged — QA1
    round 1 demonstrated this directly against ten different source paths
    on scratch repos, including a file that didn't exist at audit time.

    from the sprint FILE to STATE FILES and the REGISTRY — precisely what
    a close (and almost every other phase transition) actually writes.

    worktree_divergence_warning() above only ever compares the sprint
    file's byte content, which changes at exactly three transitions —
    new, start, complete — the only ones that call
    update_frontmatter_status(). Every other transition this lifecycle
    has (a QA1 verdict, dev_agreed_done, shipped, reshipped, a LiveQA
    verdict, a repoint) touches ONLY docs/sprints/state/sprint-<id>.json,
    invisible to that check entirely. Master Controller named the gap
    precisely: sprint 13's mechanism "says nothing about state files or
    the registry, which is precisely what a close writes." A stranded
    close (Finding A's own motivating incident) happens to ALSO change
    the sprint file's frontmatter (status: in_progress -> done), so
    worktree_divergence_warning() would catch that one case by accident —
    this function is the general fix, not a narrower one aimed only at
    closing.

    Same discipline as worktree_divergence_warning(): warns, never gates,
    and every failure mode (no git, no other worktrees, another tree's
    state file or registry missing or unreadable) collapses silently to
    None — this must never be the reason a read-only or gating command
    fails to answer.

    Compares TWO independent things per other worktree, either one
    enough to warn on its own: state.json's own `phase` (fine-grained,
    authoritative — dev_build, qa1_audit, liveqa_live, complete, ...),
    and registry.json's `status` for this sprint id (the coarse
    todo/in_progress/done bucket cmd_list and cmd_status's no-id view
    actually print). The stranded-close incident changes both; a
    mid-lifecycle phase change (e.g. dev_agreed_done -> shipped) changes
    only the first, and Req 1 requires that be visible too, not only the
    close case.

    `other_roots`, `this_phase`, `this_registry_status` are accepted as
    parameters, not always re-derived, so a caller iterating many sprints
    (cmd_list, cmd_status with no id) can compute `other_roots` ONCE via
    _other_worktree_roots() and reuse it across every sprint, instead of
    a redundant `git worktree list` subprocess call per sprint. A caller
    with only one sprint to check (cmd_status with an id, which already
    has `state` loaded) can pass what it already has and let this
    function derive the rest itself.

    QA1 round 1 FINDING, FIXED HERE: this used to `return None` the
    moment THIS tree had no local state file at all — which is exactly
    the case for a sprint created in main and then started AND closed
    entirely inside a worktree (CLAUDE.md's own documented order: create
    the sprint, run /sprint-worktree BEFORE building, start there). That
    early return bailed out before the REGISTRY comparison below ever

def origin_ahead_of_record_warning(last_shipped: Optional[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    """Sprint 24, Req 3 (Finding C): `cmd_ship` never runs when Claude
    Code's own permission classifier denies the push step before
    `cmd_ship` starts — confirmed directly, both entry points, same
    denial. So nothing INSIDE `cmd_ship` can prevent a push landing
    without its matching state write (a second, real ship — often a
    headless Pipeman's own twin — closing the window before this one's
    bookkeeping caught up). Detection after the fact, wherever
    `last_shipped_commit` is read to make a decision, is the achievable
    thing; this is that detector.

    ADDRESSING `worktree_divergence_warning()`'s OWN PRECEDENT DIRECTLY,
    rather than silently building something that looks like it
    contradicts it: that function's docstring rules out comparing against
    `origin/*` at all, because "a stale or unfetched remote ref produces
    a NEW confidently-wrong answer." This function also reads
    `origin/<upstream>`, and does NOT `git fetch` first either — so it
    earns re-examining that ruling, not just citing a different Req
    number past it.

    The two checks are not the same shape, and that's why the ruling
    doesn't transfer. `worktree_divergence_warning()` was answering "does
    another location have a DIFFERENT sprint file than this one" — a
    stale origin ref there could read as agreement when the real answer
    is unknown in either direction, a genuine false confidence. This
    function only ever answers "does origin contain at least one commit
    beyond `last_shipped_commit`" — a strictly MONOTONIC, one-directional
    question. Git history is append-only on a branch nobody force-pushes
    (this project's own standing assumption elsewhere: only Pipeman
    pushes, and never with --force). Under that assumption, a stale local
    view of `origin/<upstream>` can only ever make this function see
    FEWER of origin's commits than actually exist, never invent commits
    that aren't there — so staleness here produces under-reporting
    (silently missing a real drift a fresh fetch would show), never a
    false alarm. That is a real, named limitation, not a hidden one: run
    `git fetch` yourself first for the freshest picture. It is not the
    same failure mode `worktree_divergence_warning()` was refusing to
    risk, which is why this function is allowed to exist where that
    ruling still correctly stands for its own, different check.

    Returns None — the common, correct case — when there is nothing to
    report: no `last_shipped_commit` yet, not a git repository, no
    upstream configured for the current branch (detached HEAD, a
    local-only branch), or origin is not ahead. Returns a warning STRING,
    never raises, when it is: worded to say exactly "origin carries a
    commit your record does not," never "someone bypassed the push
    rule" — Pipeman's own first, wrong reading of this exact situation,
    the misreading this message exists to prevent.

    Sprint 29, Req 3: NAMES the commits (short SHA + subject line, via
    `git log --oneline`, capped so a long drift doesn't dump an
    unreadable wall of text), not merely a count with a suggestion to go
    look — this is deliberately the same question this function already
    answers cheaply, `git log --oneline A..B` costs no more than the
    `git rev-list --count` this replaced and returns the commits it
    would have counted anyway. This is also the mechanism cmd_liveqa uses
    to detect the branch tip moving off `last_shipped_commit` DURING the
    live gate (Finding B) — see the dedicated comment at that call site
    for why that context warns rather than refuses; this function's own
    behaviour (warn, never gate) is unchanged, only its message grew
    more specific."""

    -- a headless Dev Team 1 ran `/sprint-start 1` on a sprint already
    sitting in `liveqa_live`, and this rebuilt its state file from
    scratch, silently nulling every verdict, both audit hashes,
    `last_shipped_commit`, and the sprint's entire history (ShowOffTest
    `268a066`, reverted by hand in `55557bc`). Worse than first reported:
    `cmd_block` had no phase guard either, so a *completed* sprint could
    be blocked and then started -- a two-command path to erasing a closed
    record that a guard on start alone would leave open (see Req 2 for
    the other half of that fix).

    Exactly two outcomes now proceed, checked before ANY mutation below
    (the file move, the registry write, the state write):
      (a) no state file exists yet AND the registry's own status is
          "todo" -- genuinely never started, proceeds exactly as before
          this sprint (Req 1b: the fresh-state dict's own shape is
          unchanged by this Req; Req 3 separately adds one new schema key
          to it, see that Req's own field).
      (b) a state file exists and its phase is exactly "blocked" --
          re-filing after Master Controller has read `/sprint-block`'s
          recorded analysis and repaired the sprint file (Req 1a): history
          is KEPT and a new event is appended (log_event never replaces),
          `audit_rounds`/`live_test_rounds`/the original `started`
          timestamp are all kept, and every gate-result field is reset,
          because a repaired file must clear both gates again from
          scratch.
    Every other case refuses outright -- no override. The one legitimate
    re-entry is (b); anything else already has a documented path (block,
    then start).

    QA1 round 1 FINDING, FIXED HERE: the first version of this fix
    treated "no state file" as synonymous with "never started" -- wrong.
    `cmd_abort` on a sprint that was never `/sprint-start`'ed writes NO
    state file at all (see its own `if state_path(args.id).exists():`
    guard below); it only moves the file to 5-abandoned/ and flips the
    registry status to "abandoned". A guard that only ever checks the
    state file therefore let `/sprint-start` on such a sprint sail
    through as if it were case (a) above -- reviving an aborted sprint
    with a single ordinary command, undoing exactly what CLAUDE.md says
    abort does ("burns the sprint id and makes re-filing a human act").
    Demonstrated directly against this repo's own sprint 37 (aborted with
    no state file, per this sprint's own Out of Scope): `/sprint-start 37`
    used to succeed cleanly, moving the file back to 2-in-progress/ and
    fabricating a fresh state file whose history began at
    "sprint_started", with no trace the sprint had ever been aborted. The
    fix reads the REGISTRY's own status too, not only the state file --
    the two facts this repository tracks about a sprint that predates any
    state file (`todo` and `abandoned` are the only two `entry["status"]`
    values `cmd_start`'s own `state_path(...).exists()` check cannot
    already distinguish, since every other status implies a state file

    configured" and "CI is configured but produced no run for this
    commit" — `.github/workflows/` in the repository AT THE COMMIT BEING
    SHIPPED, not at HEAD or on GitHub's current view of the repo.

    ESTABLISHED BY RUNNING, per this Req's own instruction to check
    whether `gh` also separates the two cases and prefer whichever is
    more reliable: `gh workflow list` DOES report configured workflows,
    but it reads GitHub's current state of the default branch, not the
    tree at any specific commit — wrong question for a check that is
    supposed to be scoped to "the exact commit", the same principle
    `check_ci_status()`'s own docstring already states for run lookups.
    It also requires network and auth. `git ls-tree -r --name-only
    <commit_sha> -- .github/workflows/` answers the precise question (did
    THIS commit's tree have workflow files) with no API call and nothing
    that can fail for network reasons — confirmed directly: it exits 0
    and prints matching paths when they exist, and exits 0 with empty
    output (not an error) when the path doesn't exist in that tree at
    all, verified against both a real commit in this repo and a scratch
    repo with no .github/workflows/ whatsoever.

    Returns False (i.e. "nothing configured") on any subprocess failure
    too — collapsing "couldn't check" into the benign case is deliberate
    here and asymmetric with check_ci_status()'s own None-handling: a
    tool failure on THIS check must never manufacture the "workflows
    exist but produced nothing" alarm, which is what would make a ship
    gate flaky for a reason that has nothing to do with CI."""

def check_ci_status(commit_sha: str):
    """Returns (status, detail). status is one of CI_STATUS_GREEN,
    CI_STATUS_RED, CI_STATUS_UNDETERMINABLE — never raises, mirroring
    every other git/network-touching function in this file: a caller
    here should never have to separately catch an exception on top of
    branching on the result.

    Implementation: `gh run list --commit <sha>` (GitHub CLI; this
    project already depends on it being available and authenticated for
    Pipeman's own documented flow, so no new external dependency is
    introduced here). Filtering by the exact commit SHA, not by branch or
    "latest run" generally, is deliberate and load-bearing — a check
    scoped to a branch can read a DIFFERENT commit's green run as this
    one's, which is a worse defect than the one being fixed here.

    CI_STATUS_RED fires on ANY run found for this commit that either (a)
    completed with a conclusion other than "success" (failure, cancelled,
    timed_out, etc. — this alone already catches the reporter's own
    5-second `EUSAGE` case, since a failed install step fails the job),
    or (b) completed with conclusion "success" but, on inspection via
    `gh run view --json jobs`, has no job with at least one step that
    actually reports `status: completed` and a non-skipped conclusion —
    guarding against a workflow trivially "succeeding" because its real
    steps never ran at all (an `if:` misconfiguration, an empty job), the
    literal "whether its steps actually executed" half of this Req, which
    a bare conclusion check alone would miss. No project-specific step
    names (no hardcoded "lint"/"test"/"build") — this framework can't
    know a downstream project's own job structure, so the check is
    generic: real steps ran, or they didn't.

    A run still `in_progress`/`queued`/not yet `completed` for this
    commit is NOT graded red — this tool has no wait/poll mechanism (out
    of scope; a synchronous CLI command blocking on a running CI job is a
    materially bigger feature nobody asked for) — it is graded
    undeterminable, with its own distinct wording, so it isn't confused
    with "no CI at all."

    CI_STATUS_UNDETERMINABLE fires when: `gh` isn't installed/
    authenticated or this isn't a GitHub repository (the subprocess call
    itself fails); no CI is configured at all for this commit (see below);
    or every run found is still pending. Per this Req's own explicit
    instruction, undeterminable is NOT treated as red — a project with no
    CI, or CI this tool can't see, must not become unshippable by
    accident.

    Sprint 28, Req 1: "no runs exist yet for this exact commit" used to be
    a single undeterminable case, and it isn't one — it conflates "no CI
    configured" (benign) with "workflows exist and produced nothing for
    this commit" (not benign: indistinguishable from a pipeline broken
    badly enough to never even start, which is a real incident this
    project shipped over silently). workflows_configured_at(commit_sha)
    (above) is the split: no workflow files in this commit's own tree
    stays CI_STATUS_UNDETERMINABLE with the same benign wording as
    before; workflow files present but zero runs found for this commit
    is graded CI_STATUS_RED — reusing the existing refuse-and-say-why
    path in both callers below rather than inventing a fourth status, so
    "distinguished in behaviour, not only in wording" (this Req's own
    acceptance criterion) falls out of the existing branches for free.

    Both callers — cmd_ship AND cmd_reship (Req 4, added mid-flight once QA1 named the gap: a
    reshipped commit has never been through QA1's static audit at all,
    so exempting it here would give the least-audited path the least
    mechanical scrutiny) — print this as a warning and proceed; neither
    gates on it. Keep both callers consistent if this function's own
    grading ever changes; two call sites giving different answers to the
    same question is exactly the defect Req 4 exists to remove.

    Every subprocess call here is wrapped the same way
    git_tree_hash_excluding() and git_commit_sha() already are —
    (CalledProcessError is never raised, `check` is never passed, but
    FileNotFoundError/OSError are caught) — because `gh` simply not being
    installed at all (not just unauthenticated, or the wrong repo) is a
    real, ordinary case for a downstream project, and it must degrade to
    undeterminable exactly like every other unreachable-CI case, never an
    unhandled crash taking `cmd_ship` down with it. A 30s timeout on each
    call exists for the same reason `resolve_text()`'s file-read failures
    get a legible message instead of hanging forever: a network-touching
    command that can hang must not be able to wedge Pipeman's whole ship
    step waiting on it."""

    reporting instruction — sprint 9 fixed the equivalent gap with prose
    in pipeman.md and it drifted on the very next release (0.1.10 needed
    the post-hoc gitHead correction sprint 9 was built to eliminate).
    This reads the registry itself and prints a definitive result; it
    does not ask a role to run `npm view` by hand and assert what they
    saw.

    THE DETERMINATION THIS REQUIREMENT ASKED FOR, from actually reading
    cmd_liveqa rather than reasoning about it: cmd_liveqa's own
    --deployed-commit check is a PURE LOCAL IDENTITY comparison against
    state["last_shipped_commit"] — the exact commit SHA Pipeman named via
    --commit at ship/reship time. It never reads the npm registry and
    never needs gitHead to be present, correct, or even published at all
    to do its job. The registry-gitHead question this command answers is
    a SEPARATE, additional confidence check every sprint's LiveQA
    criteria have asked for in prose ("confirm gitHead matches
    last_shipped_commit, from npm view") — real and worth answering
    mechanically, but not something cmd_liveqa's own gate depends on.

    Primary check: if the registry has gitHead, compare it to
    last_shipped_commit exactly — a real, disk-based value now, not an
    instruction to eyeball one.

    Fallback, when gitHead is absent (recorded as a stated fact, not an
    error — sprint 9's post-hoc correction may turn out to be the correct
    workflow rather than a defect, and this command says which, plainly,
    rather than presupposing): pack_commit_shasum() against the
    registry's own dist.shasum.

    Neither outcome is a gate — this command only reports and records via
    log_event(); it never changes phase or blocks anything downstream.
    Sprint 13's Req 2 asked for a first-class step, not a new refusal.

    The slow parts (a network call, and possibly a full `npm pack`) run
    BEFORE this takes the sprint's lock, deliberately — holding a lock
    across a network round-trip would block every other command against
    this sprint for however long the registry takes to answer. The lock
    is only held for the final read-modify-write of the state file, with
    a fresh load right before it, so a concurrent ship/reship that landed
    during the slow part is never silently overwritten by a stale copy of
    `state` read before this command's own network calls even started."""

    re-filing a human act -- used to have strictly less protection than
    /sprint-complete, the least destructive one. Three defects, all fixed
    here.

    Req 1: the actor is no longer a hardcoded "human". Every other
    command in this file logs a fixed string because each one is only
    ever run by one specific role (cmd_ship -> "pipeman", cmd_complete ->
    "dev-team"); abort has no such owner -- Out of Scope names exactly
    why: every role's headless profile grants
    Bash(python3 scripts/sprint_lifecycle.py *), so every role reaches
    every subcommand, abort included. A fixed string here would just
    replace one wrong assertion with another. CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT is this
    file's own established way of asking "which role is actually running
    right now" (see save_state()'s last_claim, sprint 25) -- reused here
    for the identical question, on the identical footing as every other
    command's actor: a truthful statement of who acted, not a guess.

    Req 2: --user-said, same mechanical shape and same non-overridability
    as cmd_complete's own gate -- checked before the lock and before any
    state or file mutation, argument validation independent of sprint
    state. No flag, environment variable, or code path bypasses it.

    Req 5: the refusal names the Req 4 alternative by its actual command,
    not "see the docs" -- a role that hit this gate because IT (not a
    human) determined the sprint isn't buildable has somewhere to go
    without reading anything else, which is what makes gating abort
    admissible under this framework's own transition-precondition rule
    (a precondition must be clearable by the role that hits it, or ship
    with a documented cross-role recovery path -- this is the former).

    Req 3: --reason is now required and non-empty, same ordering as

    """Sprint 33, Req 4: the non-destructive alternative to abort, for a
    role that correctly determines a sprint is not currently buildable
    (real content doesn't exist, a required decision is unmade) without
    that being grounds to abandon it. Returns the sprint to the planner:
    the sprint id is preserved (never burned), the file is not moved to
    5-abandoned, and the role's own stated analysis is recorded in
    history where Master Controller can read it to repair the file --
    "this sprint is not buildable and here is why" is exactly what
    abandoning used to throw away.

    Moves the file to 4-blocked/, mirroring every sibling transition's
    own established pattern (new -> todo, start -> in_progress, complete
    -> done, abort -> abandoned) -- STATUS_FOLDERS["blocked"] has existed
    since this constant was defined and nothing had ever used it.
    Re-filing is free: /sprint-start <id> on a blocked sprint works,
    once Master Controller has read the analysis and fixed the file
    (Req 6) -- sprint 36, Req 1a, gave cmd_start() an explicit phase
    guard that treats exactly this phase ("blocked") as the one
    legitimate re-entry, preserving history and resetting gate results
    rather than the "no guard at all, always overwrites" behavior this
    comment used to describe (that behavior is exactly what let a
    mis-issued /sprint-start silently erase a closed sprint's record --
    see cmd_start's own docstring).

    Same actor derivation as cmd_abort, for the identical reason -- this
    command has no single owning role either. No --user-said: blocking
    is not destructive, so it does not carry cmd_complete/cmd_abort's
    human-authorization gate, only a required, non-empty analysis of
    why.

    QA1 round 1 FINDING, FIXED HERE: this used to load_state() INSIDE the
    locked block, AFTER the file had already moved to 4-blocked/ and the
    registry had already flipped to "blocked" -- so blocking a sprint
    that was never /sprint-start'ed (no state file yet, which is exactly
    when "this needs real content that doesn't exist" is normally
    discovered, per this sprint's own Context) half-mutated the record,
    reported failure, and discarded the analysis in the same breath.
    That is precisely what this command exists to prevent -- worse than
    the abandon-with-a-reason it replaces, since the result was a sprint
    sitting in 4-blocked marked blocked with no recorded why. Fixed by
    applying Req 2's own ordering here too: validate everything before
    any mutation, so a refusal never leaves anything moved. The state
    file's existence is checked before the lock, alongside --reason,
    same as cmd_complete's own "argument validation independent of
    sprint state, checked before touching anything" precedent -- state
    files are only ever created (cmd_start) and never deleted by any
    command in this file, so there is nothing to race against here.

    QA1 round 1, SECOND FINDING -- HALF CLOSED, sprint 36 Req 2: neither
    this command nor cmd_abort used to gate on phase at all, so both
    could act on an already-complete sprint. That combined with
    cmd_start's own former lack of a phase guard (see cmd_start's own
    docstring, Req 1) into a genuine two-command path to erasing a closed
    sprint's record: block a `complete` sprint, then `/sprint-start` it
    -- Req 1's own fix closed the second half of that path, and this
    closes the first. Only the closed-sprint case (`complete`, `aborted`)
    is gated here, deliberately narrower than "which in-flight phases may
    legitimately be blocked" (mid-LiveQA-loop included) -- that remains
    the real, undecided design question the original finding named, left
    to its own sprint (see the current sprint's own Out of Scope). This
    command still gates on nothing else: every phase other than
    `complete`/`aborted` may still be blocked exactly as before.
    cmd_abort itself is intentionally NOT touched here -- see cmd_abort's
    own docstring and this sprint's Out of Scope for why a phase guard on
    abort is a separate, still-open question."""

    frontmatter, and the filename together -- the three things hand-editing
    the registry (forbidden, see CLAUDE.md) would otherwise have to keep in
    sync by hand. This repo's own sprint 18 is the motivating instance
    named in the sprint file: its title stopped describing it once its
    first requirement was absorbed into another sprint, and there was no
    command to fix it, so Master Controller recorded the title as
    historical in Dependencies rather than correcting it where a reader
    would actually see it first.

    PRESERVES THE ORIGINAL TITLE (Req 4's own instruction): the registry
    entry and the frontmatter both gain an `original_title` field, set
    ONCE, on the FIRST rename, and never overwritten by a later one -- so
    it always names the sprint's true original title, not merely "the
    title before this particular rename." A sprint renamed twice still
    shows what it was at creation, not just what it was most recently.

    DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH (Req 4's own named list): phase,
    qa1_audit_result, groundtruth_result, audit_rounds, live_test_rounds,
    history, or either recorded hash (qa1_audit_file_hash,
    qa1_audited_tree_hash). state["title"] IS updated, for the identical
    reason the registry's title is -- a title nobody can ever correct is
    the bug this Req exists to fix, and title is not one of the fields
    the Req's own list protects.

    THE HASH QUESTION, TESTED RATHER THAN ASSUMED (Req 4's own explicit
    instruction: "confirm the sprint-file hash gate behaves correctly
    across a rename... if renaming invalidates a recorded QA1 PASS, say so
    and decide whether that is right"). Confirmed directly, against a real
    scratch sprint (see scripts/smoke_test.sh's own sprint-25 rename
    tests): renaming a sprint that already has a QA1 PASS on record DOES
    cause the next /sprint-dev-done to refuse, because file_hash() (see
    cmd_qa1's own qa1_audit_file_hash) hashes the sprint file's raw bytes,
    and this command's own frontmatter rewrite (new title line, plus an
    inserted original_title line on a first rename) changes those bytes --
    the same way any other edit to an audited sprint file does.

    THE DECISION: this is correct, not a bug to work around, and no
    special-case exemption is carved out here. Every other content change
    to an audited sprint file already requires a fresh /sprint-qa1 look
    before /sprint-dev-done will proceed (see that function's own
    comment) -- a rename is a real edit to the exact file QA1 read, and
    this mechanism has no way to distinguish "cosmetic title change" from
    "the requirements actually changed" without a human's judgement,
    which is exactly what re-running QA1 provides. Renaming BEFORE a QA1
    PASS (the common case Context describes -- scope narrowing discovered
    during the build) has nothing to invalidate and is unaffected."""
