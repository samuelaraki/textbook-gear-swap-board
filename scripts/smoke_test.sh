# Smoke test for the sprint lifecycle script: exercises the full happy path,

# before invoking the real script would NOT be enough: sprint_lifecycle.py
# resolves ROOT from Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent, i.e. from
# where the *script file* lives, not the caller's working directory. So
# this test copies the script (and the sprint template) into the sandbox
# and runs that copy, which makes ROOT resolve inside the sandbox instead.
# This is not a style preference: a version of this file that rm -rf'd
