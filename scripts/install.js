// Sprint 2's taxonomy (Req 1) replaces the single copy/skip/conflict
// policy sprint 1 shipped with three explicit categories, each with its
// own rule:
//
//   FRAMEWORK_OWNED — shipped and maintained upstream; the user is never
//     expected to edit these. An upgrade OVERWRITES a changed file, always
//     backing up what was there first (Req 2), and REMOVES any file under
//     a framework-owned path that no longer exists upstream, also backed
//     up first (Req 4) — state.js, deleted in sprint 1, is the file that
//     motivated this: a stale install kept carrying it forever with no
//     way to clean it up.
//   USER_OWNED — designed to be customised (agent personas, this repo's
//     own CLAUDE.md inviting you to extend its "Project standards"
//     section). A differing file is reported as a conflict, same as
//     before, just louder about whose file it is (Req 3).
//   MERGED — .vscode/settings.json, .vscode/tasks.json, .gitignore. Real
//     merge logic, unchanged by this sprint except for one narrow
//     addition (removing a specific dead .gitignore line, Req 4).
//
// A small version marker (Req 5) records which release is installed, so a
// re-run can tell "first install" from "upgrade", name backups after the
// version being replaced, and report `installed X -> Y`. It lives under
// .claude/ (not .claude/agents or .claude/commands, so it never collides
// with either taxonomy) and is never sprint state, so it doesn't live
// under docs/sprints/.
//
// Sprint 6 changes what "USER_OWNED ... never overwrites" means, for
// `.claude/agents/` and `CLAUDE.md` only (not `docs/sprints`, Req 6): a
// manifest alongside the version marker records the hash of every such
// file *as this installer wrote it*, so an upgrade can tell "shipped
// content nobody touched" from "the user customised this" and only
// overwrite the former — see readManifest()/writeManifest() and
// syncTrackedUserOwnedFile() below. Before this, every rule this
// framework ships into an agent file or CLAUDE.md reached fresh installs
// only, forever, because nothing recorded what had been written.
//
// Sprint 8 adds a second source of the same kind of proof, because the
// manifest alone only ever proves something for installs made *after*
// sprint 6 shipped — every earlier install has no manifest at all, so
// every one of them conflicted on all seven tracked files, permanently
// (sprint 6's own live gate found this in the field). scripts/baselines/
// holds the real content of every user-owned path as it was actually
// published in every prior release, generated from real npm tarballs
// (never hand-written, see scripts/baselines/generate.js) — matching an
// installed file's hash against ANY of those is exactly as strong a proof
// of "never edited" as a manifest entry. See readBaselines() and
// baselineHashesFor() below; syncTrackedUserOwnedFile() only ever
// consults baselines when there is no manifest entry at all, never as an
// override for one that already disagrees with what's on disk.
//
// Sprint 14, Req 2: every em dash (U+2014) this file used to print at
// runtime — in the conflicts section header, in individual conflict
// messages, in the Claude-login note, in the Python prerequisite warning —
// came back as "ΓÇö" on a default Windows console (the two named findings
// LiveQA reported; the rest print through the same broken console the
// same way, so fixed here together rather than one string at a time).
// That's the UTF-8 bytes of an em dash (E2 80 94) getting decoded one byte
// at a time under the console's active OEM code page (437/850), which is
// what a fresh Windows terminal uses unless something has switched it to
// UTF-8 — the code-page reasoning this Req explicitly says not to stop at.
// The fix: stop emitting the one non-ASCII character this file used at
// all (plain ASCII " - " in place of "—"), rather than make Node or the
// console negotiate an encoding — the same "no required setup" bar Req 1
// held /tmp to, and it needs no code-page change, no `chcp 65001`, no
// terminal switch to hold. CONFIRMED ON WINDOWS: run for real on the VM
// used for sprints 10/11 (a default PowerShell console, no chcp change),
// producing a genuine conflict on CLAUDE.md so the conflicts-section
// message actually printed. Every dash rendered as a plain single
// character throughout — the conflicts header, the CLAUDE.md conflict
// message, the Claude-login note — never as "ΓÇö". The Python-warning
// message specifically wasn't re-triggered live in that same run (this
// VM's simulated shape for Req 3 has a working `python`, so the
// no-interpreter branch doesn't fire there); its ASCII content is instead
// covered by the dynamic test in launcher_test.js, which spawns install.js
// with all three candidates absent from PATH and asserts the real captured
// stdout is pure ASCII — going through the identical console.log write
// path as the messages that were confirmed live.
// Scoped to install.js's own runtime output; scripts/sprint_lifecycle.py
// prints far more em dashes across nearly every command, which would
// mojibake the same way on the same console — that's a real, separate,
// much larger finding, out of scope for this Req and not fixed here.
//
// Sprint 35, Req 1: package.json's "files" array replaces a fail-open
// denylist (.npmignore, kept only as an inert explanatory note — see
// that file) with an allowlist derived from every SOURCE_ROOT path this
// file actually reads — grep this file for "SOURCE_ROOT" to re-derive it
// directly rather than trust the array matches this comment. Two
// deliberate exceptions, both NOT read by this file at runtime, both
// noted here since Req 1a asks for the reasoning to live where the next
// person will find it:
//   - CHANGELOG.md: a real, consumer-facing document (README.md's own
//     "What 0.2.0 means" section points at it) that anyone downloading
//     this package should be able to read, even though nothing in this
//     installer ever opens it.
//   - scripts/baselines/generate.js and check-staleness.js: this file
//     only ever reads scripts/baselines/user-owned-content.json
//     (BASELINES_PATH below), never the two scripts that produce and
//     verify it — but scripts/verify-tarball.sh's own pre-publish check
//     runs check-staleness.js FROM THE UNPACKED TARBALL specifically (to
//     verify what actually ships, not this repo's live source), and that
//     script requires generate.js in turn. Omitting either would not
//     break an installed project; it would silently break Pipeman's own
//     release-verification step the next time this ships, discovered
//     directly by running this sprint's own tarball build before writing
//     this comment, not assumed. Shipping the whole scripts/baselines
//     directory rather than enumerating exactly these three files means
//     a future file added there (a second generator, a second table)
//     doesn't silently drop out of the package the way an exact list
//     would.

// GUARANTEE, stated here because a downstream consumer already depends on
// it and asked whether it's intended to hold:
//
//   If `.claude/fully-completely-version` says X, every FRAMEWORK_OWNED
//   path — scripts/launcher included, the copy a target project's own
//   launcher actually executes from — is byte-for-byte release X's
//   content, right now, on this machine.
//
// Why it's safe to promise: every FRAMEWORK_OWNED file goes through
// syncFrameworkPath()/overwriteFrameworkFile(), which has no conflict
// branch and no swallowed-error branch — it either completes or throws.
// Nothing between the top of this file and this call catches a copy
// failure and continues; an fs error anywhere above aborts the whole
// process before this line runs, so there is no path that reaches here
// having silently left a framework-owned file stale or partially written.
// (The read side, readInstalledVersion() just above, is intentionally the
// opposite: any failure to read degrades to "unknown version" rather than
// crashing — a torn or missing marker is not evidence the install is
// broken, only that this run can't place it precisely.)
//
// This is what makes the "two copies of the launcher" case in a real
// install checkable: a target ends up with the scaffolded launcher under
// scripts/launcher/ (framework-owned, covered by this guarantee) AND a
// separate pinned copy under node_modules/ (an npm dependency, not synced
// by this installer at all, and NOT covered). A consumer comparing
// `.claude/fully-completely-version` against its own build/release version
// can trust the scaffolded copy matches that marker; it must not extend
// that trust to the node_modules copy, which this file never touches.
//
// What this guarantee does NOT cover: USER_OWNED tracked files
// (.claude/agents/*, CLAUDE.md). Those can be deliberately left un-synced
// on an unresolved conflict (syncTrackedUserOwnedFile's `!proven` branch)
// without aborting the run — that's Req 3's whole point, protecting a

// round 1 (sprint 6) caught the single-message version asserting
// "upstream has updated this file" unconditionally, which was false on 5
// of 7 conflicts in a real upgrade. QA1 round 2 then flagged the fix
// itself: "differs from what's on disk right now" still isn't the same
// claim as "upstream changed it" — a file whose shipped content has never
// changed at all can still differ from a hand-edited copy, and that
// difference is entirely the user's doing, not an update.
//
// `upstreamChanged` (computed by the caller, see hasUpstreamChangedSinceInstall()
// below) is what makes this honest: true only when this path's shipped
// content has actually moved at some point across every published
// baseline plus what's about to ship. When it's false, EITHER the file
// already matches what we'd install (nothing to show), OR upstream's
// content has simply never changed (so any observed difference is 100%
// the user's edit, not a pending update) — both are truthfully "nothing
// to reconcile from our side," which is exactly why the caller only needs
// to pass one boolean rather than every intermediate fact. `npx
// fully-completely` into an empty directory is the one way to get a fresh
// copy that works regardless of how this project got installed (npx, a
// cloned repo, a git submodule), so that's what's pointed at rather than
// guessing at a source path on this machine.

// wording to that phrase on the assumption hasUpstreamChangedSinceInstall
// always establishes it — but that function's own fallback path (no
// baseline data for the exact installed version) only establishes the
// weaker "changed somewhere in the versions we do have data for", not
// "since the version you have" specifically. QA1 caught this live: the
// baseline table lagged three published releases behind at the time, so
// EVERY 0.1.6/0.1.7/0.1.8 install hit the fallback, and a user on any of
// those who'd edited a file that genuinely never changed (liveqa.md,
// constant since 0.1.3) was told upstream had updated it — false, and not
// a rare case, the common one at the time. Regenerating the baseline
// table fixes today's installs; this is what keeps the message honest
// even when that table goes stale again next release, since the true
// branch below only claims what's actually known instead of assuming

// Sprint 8, Req 5: conflicts no longer set a non-zero exit code. The
// original commit (3b52121, sprint "Add VS Code launcher...") introduced
// `process.exitCode = 1` here with no comment explaining why; the closest
// available reasoning is that a conflict was, at the time, a rare signal
// worth a script or CI wrapper treating as noteworthy. Sprint 6 changed
// what a conflict IS: every one of these categories (a user-owned file we
// can't prove untouched, a merge we can't safely perform) is the
// installer correctly DECLINING an unsafe action and reporting it loudly
// — the mechanism working as designed, not a failure of the tool. Sprint
// 6's own Context is the concrete case this makes acute: every pre-0.1.5
// install conflicts on all seven user-owned files on its first upgrade,
// permanently (now reduced, not eliminated, by sprint 8's baselines) — an
// exit code that fires on that outcome is indistinguishable from "always
// fires for every existing install", which has no signalling value left.
// The new contract: exit 0 means the run completed without the installer
// itself failing to do its job; a non-zero exit is reserved for an actual
// error — the "run this from inside the target project, not from this
// repo" guard near the top of this file (still a hard `process.exit(1)`)
// and an uncaught exception are the only ways to reach one. One real call
// site branches on this exit code — scripts/verify-tarball.sh:47's `(cd
// "$TARGET" && node "$UNPACKED/scripts/install.js") || fail ...` — and it
// is unaffected and actually improved by this change: that target is
// always a fresh empty directory, so it never produced a conflict to
// begin with, and the new contract makes a genuine install.js failure
// (what that check exists to catch) distinguishable from a routine
// conflict in a way the old blanket exitCode=1 never was; README,
// package.json, and launcher_test.js's own runInstall() helper don't
// branch on the exit code at all.
