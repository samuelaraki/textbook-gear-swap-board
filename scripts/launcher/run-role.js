// Invoked by .vscode/tasks.json, one process per role terminal:
//   node scripts/launcher/run-role.js <role-id> [--restart]
//
// Default (smart): resumes the highest existing session generation for
// this (role, repo) pair if one exists on disk (`claude --agent <id>
// --resume <uuid>`); otherwise launches fresh at generation 0 (`claude
// --agent <id> --session-id <uuid> --name <title> "<initial prompt>"`).
// Both the session ID and the resume-vs-fresh decision come from
// scripts/launcher/session.js, which derives everything from the
// filesystem — there is no local state file. This is the task actually
// named after the role ("Master Controller", "QA1", ...), since it's the
// one people run day to day.
//
// --restart: skip resume entirely and always start a brand-new named
// session at the next generation, even if one is already recorded.
// Previous history isn't deleted, just not reconnected to — but the new
// session becomes the one the *next* normal launch resumes, since that's
// just whatever the filesystem scan finds as the new highest generation.
// Not wired into any VS Code task — VS Code ties a dedicated terminal's
// identity to the task's label, so a second task for the same role would
// open a second terminal alongside the first rather than replacing it.
// Run this by hand instead (e.g. from Shell) when you actually want to
// abandon a session.
//
// Model is never passed here — `--agent <id>` alone puts the agent file's
// own frontmatter `model:` in charge (confirmed to win even over an
// explicit --model), so frontmatter stays the single place a model is set.
//
// Sprint 11 adds a second, separate launch path, for driving a role
// headless — no terminal, no human in the loop. The default, composed
// shape (Req 3, amended mid-build):
//   node scripts/launcher/run-role.js --headless --agent qa1 --sprint 4
// One parameter, the sprint id — the launcher composes the opening prompt
// itself, from this role's own built-in template (headlessPrompt() in
// prompts.js). --agent works as a flag here (not just the interactive
// path's leading positional argument) so this shape needs nothing else on
// the command line; the leading positional role-id still works too, for
// callers that prefer it (see main()'s roleId resolution below).
//
// An explicit override remains available, read from a path, never passed
// as prompt text on a command line, and wins over --sprint when given:
//   node scripts/launcher/run-role.js --headless --agent qa1 --prompt-file <path>
//
// By default headless runs on the operator's own logged-in Claude session
// (Req 4, reversed mid-build — see runHeadless() below). --bare opts into
// the original isolated-credential behavior instead, for a consumer that
// specifically wants headless not to share this session:
//   node scripts/launcher/run-role.js --headless --agent qa1 --sprint 4 --bare [--settings <path-or-json>]
// --settings is only meaningful alongside --bare — it forwards verbatim to
// claude's own --settings flag, the real path for an apiKeyHelper-based
// project (see runHeadless() below).
//
// Requested by a real external orchestrator (a downstream consumer, not
// a hypothetical one) that installs this framework and drives
// docs/sprints/ from outside, through
// sprint_lifecycle.py and state files only, never reading agent files or
// editing sprint files. See runHeadless() and its neighbors below for
// what headless does differently from the interactive path above, and why.

// Sprint 15, Req 3: fixes a real, confirmed orphan, established by running
// it rather than by reasoning about signal semantics. Repro before this
// fix (POSIX; this file's `spawn()` never passes `detached`, so the child
// starts in the same process group as this launcher): start a role, note
// the child claude PID from `ps`, `kill -TERM <this-launcher's-own-pid>`
// from a second shell, watch `ps -o ppid= -p <child-pid>` — the child's
// ppid flips to 1 within about five seconds and it is still running past
// a minute, unkilled and still billing. Matches the sprint file's own
// field report from published 0.1.13 exactly (a real orphan, not a
// hypothetical one).
//
// Cause: `kill <pid>` (a plain kill, and what a timeout-based external
// orchestrator's own kill() call does) signals exactly the one PID it's
// given — never the process group. With no handler registered here,
// Node's default SIGTERM disposition terminates only THIS process; the
// child is never sent anything at all, so it's simply abandoned mid-run,
// gets reparented to PID 1 by the kernel, and keeps going.
//
// Ctrl-C in an interactive terminal is a genuinely different delivery
// path, and was never broken: a terminal's job control signals the whole
// foreground PROCESS GROUP, which this launcher and its child already
// share (again, never detached) — both processes already receive Ctrl-C's
// SIGINT directly and independently from the terminal, with or without
// anything registered below. Established by running it, not by reasoning
// about terminal semantics: a real pseudo-terminal (Python's stdlib
// `pty.fork()`, since an actual keypress isn't scriptable) running a
// stand-in launcher+child pair, sent the real Ctrl-C byte (0x03) on the
// pty's master side so the kernel's own tty line discipline is what turns
// it into SIGINT — not a direct kill() from the test. Both processes gone
// afterward (checked via `ps` from outside the pty), run once with the
// guard installed on the child and once without: identical outcome, both
// times — this fix changes nothing about that path.
//
// So the fix only needs to cover the path Ctrl-C doesn't reach: a signal
// that arrives at this launcher process and nowhere else. SIGINT is
// deliberately NOT handled here — registering a listener for it would
// suppress Node's own default SIGINT action on THIS process, and this
// process already gets Ctrl-C's SIGINT delivered directly by the
// terminal's process-group signalling above; adding a second, redundant
// forwarding path for it would only risk racing behaviour that already
// works, for no benefit.
//
// Named limits, not implied coverage (Req 3's own instruction):
//   - SIGKILL cannot be caught by any process, by POSIX definition — no
//     code anywhere can make a SIGKILL'd launcher clean up its child.
//     An orchestrator that wants this cleanup to run MUST use SIGTERM
//     (the default signal both plain `kill` and Node's own
//     child_process .kill() send), not -9/SIGKILL.
//   - Windows has no POSIX signal delivery at all; Node's own docs are
//     explicit that SIGTERM/SIGHUP aren't meaningfully deliverable there.
//     This mechanism is POSIX-only (macOS/Linux) and unverified on
//     Windows — not assumed to also cover it. A `taskkill` there is closer
//     in effect to SIGKILL than SIGTERM: nothing intercepts it. `claude`
//     also runs as a grandchild of `cmd.exe` on Windows (see
//     claude-cmd.js), one more layer this mechanism doesn't reach.

// headless launch path is exactly the kind of feature that could quietly
// become that loophole if this weren't kept true on purpose. A headless
// role never spawns, calls into, or shares a process with any other
// role's session; it is one process, doing one role's one-shot piece of
// work, printing one JSON result, then exiting.
//
// Discovered by running it, not by reading: `--agent <id>` ALONE fails in
// --bare mode with "not found. Available agents: claude, Explore,
// general-purpose, Plan, statusline-setup" — Claude Code's own built-in
// types, not this project's .claude/agents/*.md personas, because --bare
// skips reading them entirely (consistent with its own documented
// CLAUDE.md-auto-discovery skip). The fix, also confirmed by running it:
// supply the persona explicitly via
// `--agents '{"<id>":{"description":...,"prompt":...,"model":...}}'`
// alongside `--agent <id>` — agents.js's agentBody()/readAgentMeta() below
// build this from the exact same frontmatter/body split the interactive
// path already uses, so the two can never describe the persona
// differently. Confirmed against a real successful (non-bare, OAuth) run
// this round: `model` inside this JSON IS honored — a role launched via
// this path ran as its own frontmatter model, not a default.
//
// Req 4, amended mid-build: reverses the original isolation goal.
// --bare is now opt-in (see `bare` below), not unconditional — the
// default path runs on the operator's own logged-in session, same as
// interactive. --bare, when given, still needs its own credentials
// exactly as QA1 rounds 1-2 verified: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or `settings`
// forwarded verbatim as `--settings <value>` (a path to a JSON file or an
// inline JSON string — --bare's own documented apiKeyHelper mechanism,
// meaningless without --bare so only applied there). Positioned before
// `prompt`, which must stay the final, positional argument either way.
//
// Req 4's own bar: "a documented unsuppressible side effect is
// acceptable; an assumed-away one is not." --bare's help text names eight
// things it bundles: hooks, LSP, plugin sync, attribution, auto-memory,
// background prefetches, keychain reads, and CLAUDE.md auto-discovery.
// Findings below are what was actually run and observed on the non-bare
// path (QA1 round 3: these were missing from this comment entirely,
// which is indistinguishable from assuming them away — fixed now):
//   - Hooks: CONFIRMED still fire. A real project-level SessionStart hook
//     (a `.claude/settings.json` writing a marker file) fired on a plain
//     non-bare run with no --safe-mode. Unsuppressed, undocumented
//     workaround exists on this path.
//   - CLAUDE.md auto-discovery: CONFIRMED still happens. A real run in a
//     scratch directory with a marker phrase in CLAUDE.md echoed that
//     phrase back when asked. Unsuppressed.
//   - `--safe-mode` (the one flag that looked like it might suppress
//     several of these at once) is NOT usable here at all: confirmed by
//     running it, it also disables the explicit `--agents` override this
//     whole mechanism depends on — "--agent 'test' not found. Available
//     agents: claude, Explore, general-purpose, Plan" — so it was ruled
//     out, not left untried.
//   - Attribution: ONE real test (a headless run instructed to make a git
//     commit with an exact, explicit message) showed no attribution
//     trailer added. Weak evidence, stated as such — it doesn't rule out
//     attribution behavior on a commit message the model composes itself
//     rather than one dictated verbatim, which wasn't tested.
//   - Auto-memory: no `memory/` directory appeared under
//     ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/ after several trivial one-shot test runs
//     — but that plausibly reflects the prompts being too trivial to
//     trigger memory generation, not confirmed suppression. Inconclusive,
//     documented as such rather than claimed as a finding.
//   - LSP, plugin sync, background prefetches, keychain reads: NOT
//     individually tested — no practical way found to observe any of the
//     four from outside the process in the time available. Genuinely
//     unknown, not assumed suppressed.
// `--no-session-persistence` (--print-only, confirmed compatible with the
// explicit --agents override by running it) is NOT one of --bare's eight
// bundled items — it addresses a separate, independently-found footprint
// concern: a one-shot, unattended headless run has nothing to resume
// later, so letting it persist a session transcript under
// ~/.claude/projects/... anyway (confirmed: a real non-bare run left a
// `.jsonl` transcript file behind) is its own avoidable side effect, fixed
// here because a working, tested fix existed for it specifically.
// Sprint 12, Req 3: DECIDED — a scoped profile, not blanket bypass. Full
// evidence in docs/sprint-12-permission-scope-findings.md (sprint 12's own
// worktree): `--permission-mode acceptEdits` auto-approves Edit/Write
// WITHIN the launch directory (confirmed: a write outside it, to an
// absolute /tmp path, was still blocked under acceptEdits — the directory
// confinement Req 2 asked to test appears to already be inherent, not
// something this file needs to configure separately), but still requires
// approval for `npm`, `curl`, and running any interpreter-invoked script
// (`node scripts/*`, `python3 scripts/*`) — the exact wall Dev Team 1 hit
// directly attempting `node scripts/run-lifecycle.js status`.
// `--allowedTools "Bash(<pattern>)"` was confirmed to narrow genuinely
// rather than nominally (allowlisting npm never opened curl; allowlisting
// one script path never opened script execution generally; multiple
// space-separated patterns in one string — the shape used below — were
// confirmed to combine correctly). `--disallowedTools "Edit,Write"` was
// confirmed to hard-disable those TOOLS outright ("No such tool
// available"), used for qa1 and liveqa below since neither writes source.
//
// Sprint 17, Req 2 — the boundary this file kept getting wrong, stated
// once, plainly, here: **`acceptEdits` governs TOOL use (Edit, Write). It
// says nothing about Bash.** Every Bash command, including git, needs its
// own `--allowedTools` entry or it isn't approved — full stop, regardless
// of `--permission-mode`. This is the third time this exact conflation
// produced a real, shipped defect: sprint 12 itself found the sibling
// case (QA1's own finding, re-checked against this new wording as this
// Req's own criterion requires) — a plain Bash redirect (`echo x > file`)
// still WRITES even with `--disallowedTools "Edit,Write"` set, because
// disallowing the Edit/Write TOOLS never touched Bash's own ability to
// redirect output; and this sprint found the mirror image — this file's
// own comment claimed git was "free under acceptEdits" and pipeman's
// profile had no git entry at all, so a headless ship attempt was denied
// and correctly reported BLOCKED. Tools and Bash are two independent
// axes; neither `--permission-mode` nor `--disallowedTools` reaches
// across to the other, in either direction. State it once, here, so the
// next person extending a profile doesn't have to rediscover it a fourth
// time.
//
// Sprint 17, Req 1 finding, recorded honestly rather than smoothed over:
// re-testing the git-push denial directly against the CURRENT `claude`
// CLI (2.1.261 — a point release newer than 2.1.260, recorded during
// sprint 14's own testing days earlier) in the DEFAULT, non-`--bare`
// headless path, `git push` to a real bare local remote succeeded with
// ZERO permission_denials, using pipeman's OLD profile with no git entry
// at all — the exact opposite of this sprint's own Context claim, and of
// the denial LiveQA actually observed. Reproduced three times (a bare
// `git push`, a ten-command git sweep, a bare `git status`), all clean.
// This was NOT re-tested under `--bare` mode (no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
// available in this environment) — an external, unattended orchestrator
// is exactly the kind of caller likely to use `--bare`,
// and that mode's Bash behavior was never independently confirmed here to
// match the default path's. Given that gap, and given the whole point of
// Req 2 above is that undocumented, version-dependent "it happens to work
// today" behavior is not something to build on, git is allowlisted
// explicitly below regardless of whether the symptom currently
// reproduces in default mode — the CLI already changed once inside this
// same investigation; relying on its current unlisted-git behavior
// staying this way would just be next sprint's instance of this same
// mistake.
//
// Every role needs the two lifecycle-script invocation patterns — every
// slash command ultimately runs through one of them. Beyond that, each
// role gets exactly what Req 1's own per-role breakdown named, nothing
// broader:
//   - dev-team-1/2: writes source (covered by acceptEdits alone) and runs
//     THIS PROJECT'S OWN declared test command (readDeclaredTestCommand()
//     below — the sprint's own "if the honest answer is that the target
//     must declare it, say so and define where": defined in
//     .vscode/settings.json's `fullyCompletely.testCommand`, merged in by
//     install.js with no default value, since no single command is
//     correct across every downstream project). No declaration -> no
//     test-running Bash permission at all, an honest gap rather than a
//     guess. The old hardcoded `Bash(node scripts/launcher_test.js)` and
//     `Bash(bash scripts/verify-tarball.sh)` patterns are gone entirely —
//     both are THIS repo's own dev tooling (see CLAUDE.md's "Changes to
//     this repo's own tooling"), never a downstream project's, and
//     verify-tarball.sh specifically has no downstream equivalent at all.
//   - qa1: the identical test-running mechanism as dev-team, for the
//     identical reason — QA1's own process (qa1.md) requires demonstrating
//     a FAIL with "a command whose output shows the defect," which means
//     running the target's own tests, not this repo's.
//   - pipeman: git, enumerated by subcommand rather than `Bash(git *)`
//     (Req 3's own named example) — status/log/diff/fetch (branch review,
//     step 2), add/commit (step 9.3 and conflict resolution), rebase/merge
//     (step 5), checkout (conflict resolution, step 4), push (steps 6 and
//     9.3, the headline gap). npm held to the same standard on QA1's
//     round-1 finding (round 1 shipped blanket `Bash(npm *)`, which — like
//     `Bash(git *)` — reaches well past pipeman's actual job: `npm
//     install` alone runs arbitrary unattended postinstall scripts, which
//     nothing pipeman.md documents it ever needing): `npm publish` (step
//     9.2, confirmed clean including `--dry-run` under exactly this
//     profile), `npm view` (step 10's `gitHead` check), `npm pack` (the
//     inspection step 9.1's own tarball leak-check performs when that
//     script is present — see pipeman.md step 9.1's own conditional).
//   - liveqa: npm and npx added and TESTED (not inferred from the
//     definition, per this Req's own instruction) — `npx <published
//     package>` into a scratch directory, confirmed clean under exactly
//     this profile. `npm install` narrowed the same way as pipeman's npm
//     (round-1 shipped blanket `Bash(npm *)` here too) — Req 1's own text
//     names installing a published package as the job, which `npm
//     install` states directly. `Bash(npx *)` deliberately stays broad,
//     an argued exception rather than an oversight: the whole point of
//     `npx <package>` here is running THIS SPRINT'S published package
//     under test, whose name is a different string for every downstream
//     project and every sprint — there is no fixed prefix narrower than
//     the subcommand itself to enumerate against, unlike git's or npm's
//     fixed, known verb set. The real browser-driving tools (Playwright/
//     Chrome MCP) still aren't scoped here — out of reach of a
//     synthetic-agent scratch test, untested as such, not assumed to need
//     broader Bash.
//   - master-controller: writes a sprint file (covered by acceptEdits
//     alone, confirmed directly in sprint 14 — not inferred, and
//     re-confirmed unregressed here). Unchanged by this sprint.
// Sprint 19, Req 1/5: the broad grant, opt-in per repository via
// resolveOwnedRepositoryGrant() above. Every entry here is a real,
// non-empty command prefix -- established by running it (this sprint's
// own build) that a bare `Bash(*)` (or the bare tool name `Bash` with no
// pattern at all) genuinely disables Claude Code's own separate,
// path-based redirect-confinement check: a write to an absolute path
// OUTSIDE the working directory succeeded, with zero permission_denials,
// under exactly that shape -- reproduced three times. A real, specific
// prefix pattern, even a broad one like `Bash(git *)`, does NOT have this
// effect -- confirmed directly, same test, same result every time: the
// identical "Output redirection ... was blocked" refusal Req 5 exists to
// re-verify. So this list is deliberately never a wildcard, no matter how
// broad -- that's not a stylistic choice, it's the only shape that keeps
// Req 5's confinement bound intact at all.
//
// Named as incomplete, on purpose (same principle as Req 6's own bare-
// interpreter list): this covers the toolchain surface actually reported
// (npx, a local node_modules binary, curl, git) plus the common
// neighbours of each, not literally every build tool that exists. A
// project whose toolchain needs something not listed here will still see
// a denial -- that denial is honest, not a defect this list claims to
// have eliminated. `git push` is carried in DISALLOWED, not left out of
// ALLOWED, so `git` stays broadly usable for review/build purposes while
// Req 7's own invariant ("Pipeman remains the only pusher") holds exactly
// as before -- confirmed directly: `Bash(git *)` allowed plus
// `Bash(git push *)` disallowed lets `git status` through and denies
// `git push` outright, in the same real test.
// `node *`, `python3 *`, `bash *`, `sh *` are deliberately included here,
// even though a BARE, argument-less declaration of any one of them is
// exactly what Req 6's readDeclaredTestCommand() validation exists to
// reject. The two are different trust boundaries, not a contradiction:
// Req 6 guards a value a TARGET PROJECT's own tracked settings file can
// declare -- reachable by anyone with write access to that file, with no
// separate act of trust from the operator running the agent. This list
// only ever applies once the operator has ALREADY made the highest-trust
// act available in this framework (declaring the repository their own,
// validated above) -- at that point, `node`/`bash`/`python3` are exactly
// the core toolchain commands a real build needs (`node scripts/build.js`,
// `bash setup.sh`, `python3 setup.py`), and excluding them would defeat
// this sprint's own motivating case.
//
// QA1 round 1, correcting a claim this comment used to make: the risk
// these four carry is NOT "bounded by directory confinement" the way the
// heading above implies. Checked directly, at QA1's own prompt, rather
// than left as an assertion: `bash -c 'echo x > /tmp/x'` and `python3 -c
// "open('/tmp/x','w').write('x')"` both wrote OUTSIDE the working
// directory, zero permission_denials, no refusal at all. The redirect-
// confinement check (the "Output redirection ... was blocked" message
// Req 5's own re-verification relies on) is narrower than its name
// suggests: it recognises literal `>`/`>>` shell syntax in the OUTER
// command Claude Code itself parses, and nothing past that boundary --
// not a redirect hidden inside a `bash -c '...'` quoted argument, and not
// a file write performed by an interpreter's OWN native API (`open()`,
// `fs.writeFileSync()`) with no shell redirect anywhere in the command at
// all. `node -e "require('fs').writeFileSync('/tmp/x','x')"` was checked
// the same way and escapes identically.
//
// This is NOT unique to the four interpreters, and narrowing to just
// those four would have been a cosmetic fix, not a real one: `curl -o
// /tmp/x <url>` was checked the same way, escapes identically, and `curl`
// was never in question. The actual boundary is: any tool with its own
// "write to this path" argument -- an interpreter's inline-eval flag, a
// downloader's `-o`/`-O`, and almost certainly others never explicitly
// tried here (this list was not exhaustively probed for every entry) --
// sits entirely outside what the redirect-confinement check's pattern
// matching was ever built to recognise. It is a real backstop against the
// most literal, careless shell redirect, not a filesystem sandbox, and
// this comment previously overstated it as the latter.
//
// What ACTUALLY bounds this grant, stated accurately as four legs, not as
// "directory confinement" (sprint 18, Req 3 -- retiring that phrase
// everywhere it implied more than sprint 12 established):
//   1. Git recoverability for anything inside this repository except
//      uncommitted work (Req 4, accepted and named) and .env.
//   2. .env's own OS-level, command-independent protection (Req 3) -- the
//      one file this sprint protects against exactly this class of
//      escape, which is why Req 3 doesn't rely on Bash pattern matching
//      at all.
//   3. `Bash(git push *)` carried in OWNED_REPOSITORY_DISALLOWED_TOOLS
//      below, so nothing this grant touches leaves this machine except
//      through Pipeman's own separate, narrower profile -- confirmed
//      directly (see headlessPermissionArgs' own test coverage) that the
//      carve-out survives even under the broad grant.
//   4. The operator's own explicit, auditable act of declaring this
//      repository theirs, on their own machine, trusting the agent with
//      it.
// Nothing here stops a sufficiently determined or badly-instructed agent
// from writing somewhere else on the filesystem entirely, the same
// residual risk npx/npm already carry the moment arbitrary package
// execution is granted at all (a package's own code has exactly the same
// file-system reach as `node -e` does -- there was never a narrower
// boundary there either). Legs 1, 2 and 3 are real, checkable properties
// of this grant; leg 4 is a trust decision, not a sandbox, and it is what
// the first three ultimately rest on -- not a technical sandbox this file
// can prove airtight. See Out of Scope: this was never meant to make an
// unattended broad grant safe in someone else's accounts, and this finding
// is exactly why that line is there.

// ESTABLISHED BY RUNNING, per this Req's own instruction, not inferred
// from the shape of the existing `Bash(...)` entries above (a genuinely
// different pattern shape -- MCP tool names carry no parentheses and no
// trailing ` *` wildcard-on-arguments, they're matched as literal tool
// names, the same shape `Edit`/`Write` already use in disallowedTools
// above): a real `@playwright/mcp` server was launched via `--mcp-config`
// against a scratch directory, its actual tool names discovered by asking
// a live session to enumerate them (not assumed from the package's own
// docs), then `--allowedTools` tested directly against two of them. A
// bare exact tool name (`mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`) allowed that
// one call and denied a sibling (`mcp__playwright__browser_close`) not on
// the list -- confirmed via a real permission_denials entry naming the
// denied tool exactly. A server-level wildcard (`mcp__playwright__*`)
// was also confirmed to work, granting every tool from that server. Both
// mechanisms genuinely work; the list below deliberately uses the
// enumerated form, not the wildcard, for one reason named plainly:
// `@playwright/mcp`'s own tool set (24 tools, confirmed by running) includes
// `browser_run_code_unsafe`. Its own tool description (read directly from
// the live server, not paraphrased): "Run a Playwright code snippet.
// Unsafe: executes arbitrary JavaScript in the Playwright server process
// and is RCE-equivalent." That is HOST-side execution -- on the machine
// running the agent, with a `page` handle passed in but no browser-page
// sandbox around the code itself, Node.js-equivalent reach (filesystem,
// process spawning, network) named by the tool's own author as
// RCE-equivalent. Nothing in liveqa.md's job needs that, and the wildcard
// has no way to grant everything else while excluding it specifically --
// the enumerated list exists for this one exclusion.
//
// QA1 round 1 (Sprint 23) correctly caught that this same "arbitrary code
// execution" language, as originally written here, would apply equally
// to `browser_evaluate`, which this list DOES grant -- and that the
// distinction, if real, needed to be stated, not assumed. Checked
// directly against the live tool definition rather than inferred a
// second time: `browser_evaluate`'s own description is "Evaluate
// JavaScript expression on page or element," taking a `function` field
// documented as `() => {...}` or `(element) => {...}`. That runs inside
// the BROWSER PAGE's own JavaScript engine -- the same sandbox any
// website's own script already runs in on that page (DOM, that page's
// cookies/localStorage, `fetch()` from that page's origin), not on the
// host machine, no filesystem or process access, nothing RCE-equivalent
// about it. That is the real distinction: host-process arbitrary
// execution (`run_code_unsafe`) versus page-sandboxed JavaScript
// (`evaluate`), not "both are arbitrary code execution" as this comment
// used to conflate them. `evaluate` is genuinely ordinary, commonly-
// needed browser automation (reading localStorage, computed DOM state);
// `run_code_unsafe` is a different capability class entirely, and that
// is why only one of the two is excluded.
//
// Every other tool from the confirmed 24-tool set is included:
// liveqa.md's own opening sentence names five (navigate, click, type,
// snapshot, screenshot/read-accessibility-tree) but its own "YOUR TEST
// PROCESS" and "HUNT SPECIFICALLY FOR" sections name real needs beyond
// that short list -- waiting on loading states (`wait_for`), catching
// runtime errors via the console (`console_messages`), trying to break
// things (`drag`/`drop`, `file_upload`, `fill_form`), handling a dialog
// that appears mid-flow (`handle_dialog`), checking what a page actually

// POSTURE, STATED HONESTLY (Req 2's own explicit acceptance criterion --

// working directory with zero denials, and `npx` reaches at least as far
// (it runs a published package's own code, which has the same filesystem
// reach `node -e` does). Adding the two lists above is convenience for a
// role that could already reach an equivalent surface, not a new class of
// capability. Do not read this comment as claiming these additions widen
// what LiveQA could already do; they widen what it can do *without first
// improvising through `npx` or an equivalent*, which is a different and
// much smaller claim.
//
// A LOUDER, NEWER FACT, found while establishing the above and stated
// here because staying silent about it would misrepresent what this
// profile actually protects: scripts/permission-gate-repro.js (committed
// separately, QA1-verified independent of any sprint gate) found that on
// the claude version installed while this sprint was built (2.1.265), a
// SINGLE, non-chained Bash command with NO matching `allowedTools` entry
// at all executed with zero permission denials -- reproduced for this
// exact `liveqa` profile specifically, not inferred from another role's.
// That directly contradicts the evidence this file's own permission
// architecture otherwise rests on (docs/sprint-12-permission-scope-findings.md,
// last re-confirmed on 2.1.261: "every Bash command... needs its own
// `--allowedTools` entry or it isn't approved -- full stop"). If that
// finding holds on whatever claude version is actually running a given
// launch, the lists above are not the operative confinement boundary at
// all on that version -- an absent entry may already be no different
// from a present one. This sprint does not fix that (it is explicitly
// out of scope for a profile-scoping change to fix a CLI-level
// enforcement question), and narrowing either list above further would
// not fix it either. The lists still matter for exactly what they always
// mattered for: what's granted on a version where the gate IS enforcing
// absence, which every version through 2.1.261 was confirmed to do, and
// no version has been confirmed NOT to eventually stop doing except this
// one specific point. Whoever reads this profile next should re-run

// targeting the redirect target, e.g. "Bash(printf * > .env*)", was
// tested directly and does NOT block "printf x > .env"; there is no
// generic file-target restriction in that system, only command-prefix
// matching). What DOES work, confirmed by running it: the filesystem's
// own immutable flag. macOS's `chflags uchg` blocks writes AND deletes
// with a real OS-level EPERM, regardless of which of several different
// commands (printf redirect, rm) attempts either -- confirmed directly,
// three ways, in the same real test.
//
// Linux's `chattr +i` is no longer an unverified claim -- CI running this

// it both ways. It blocks write and delete exactly like chflags does,

// rather than proceeding unprotected when it does not -- the mechanism
// is not weaker than documented, it is simply not always available, and
// the code does not pretend otherwise. Windows has no equivalent single
